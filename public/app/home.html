    <h1>arrange with orrange</h1>
    <p>for too long, musicians have relied on printed chord charts to remind them about a song's structure, arrangement, chord progressions. annotating these documents meant messy scribbles and overload of information. nobody wants to keep track of every song you've ever had to learn, espcially in today's digital age. that's where <strong>orrange</strong> comes in.</p>
